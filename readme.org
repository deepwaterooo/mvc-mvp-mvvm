* MVC MVP MVVP 
- today is all about android libraries/modules/SDK APIs, SDK API design for android
  apps, including this multiple library tiny proj (still has data
  binding runtime bugs to be fixed).
- to look deeper, when there are intersepted dependencies within multiple
  module projects, the packing of dependencies into .aar could be
  challenging issues (bug: duplicated dependency etc) to solve on hands on projects, but nothing unsolvable。。。 
- Need to dig slightly deeper into android SDK - Unity game
  communication callbacks API design for both android SDK side, and
  Unity game side, and also unity game builds process when there is
  SDK upgrade, and understand all the theories behind it.
